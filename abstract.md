Authors: Awwal Mohammed; Caroline S. Selvarajah

## Abstract

Time management and work allocation are some of the most important aspects of conducting business operations or completing projects. Various investigations by previous researchers have shown that issues that manifest as a result of improper work allocation techniques and time management procedures include (but not limited to) indelicate actualization of tasks, noncompliance with established regulatory procedures, and lack of total identification of workforce expertise domain. This paper discusses a proposed system that aims to adapt the characteristics of the ALPEN time management framework (ALPEN stands for Activity, Length, Planning, Establishment of priorities, Notation) in conjunction with the paradigms of work allocation, into a mobile application. The backgrounds, core introduction of the relevant elements, literature review, applicable development technologies, and potentially suitable methodologies are subsequently covered herewith. We deploy the proposed system on the Android platform with Firebase as the main backend. We analyse and justify the rationale behind the methodologies we applied in developing the proposed system. We deem the end results acceptable upon evaluating the usability of the proposed system using the ISO 9126 criteria-based assessment evaluation technique.
